                <span>About me</span>
                <p>I'm an aspiring Freelance Web Developer Living in Guelph Ontario. Currently studying Professional Development in Web Design and Development at The University of Waterloo, 
                    I also studied Computer Sciences in High School and have experience in HTML5 & CSS3 as well as JavaScript and Java. I want to strengthen my knowledge of these subjects and 
                    develop a better understanding of the Web Design/Development space. I have some projects in mind that I want to work on as well as start learning Game Development since that 
                    was a goal of mine when I was younger.</p>
